### Widget
A widget is a superset of an Angular 1.x directive that is tightly coupled to a server-side JavaScript code block powered by the Rhino engine under the ServiceNow platform.
Since widgets are `read-only` to benefit from future updates, you can't update their code. If you need to make major changes,
clone the widget and give it another `name` and `id`.

### Widget Instance
A widget instace is a reference to a widget that contains: location, properties and CSS especific for that instance. A widget used multiple times in the same page, will use multiple instances.


### Embeded Widgets
The spWidget directive takes a widget model and renders the compiled widget exactly where you put it in your HTML Template.
